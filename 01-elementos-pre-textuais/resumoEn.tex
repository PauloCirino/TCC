\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
The theme of this work is the creation of a software capable of automating parts of machine learning models benchmarking.

A software capable of comparing established machine learning model  with ones created by the user was made in this project. The software loads databases, create function calls for testing, implements avaliation functions and defines statistical tests routines for quality mesures in classification ajd regression problems.

The discussion of social impact of free software and the technical and mathematical aspects of supervised learning, is also part of the project. And, in the end the software is presented along with a demo code.

\textbf{Keywords}: Free Software. Machine Learning. R programming Language. Model Testing. Benchmarking.
